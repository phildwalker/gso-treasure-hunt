# Activity

Congrats you've succeeded in getting in 2-3 hours of light to moderate of activity and you've seen some of the fun activities that Greensboro has to offer.

Now send the purveyors of this fun game 6 pictures of the gnome to show you've succeeded and enjoy a beer (or 3) on us (and eventually return gnome back to their gnome friends at casa de walker)
