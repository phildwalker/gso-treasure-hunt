Congrats you got an treasure map in a box! Woohoo!


We've hidden clues and activites throughout downtown Greensboro for you to find (and refreshments to consume along the way, because hydration is key!)


We've provided a #GnomeOnLoan from the Lauren collection because we all know that gnomes love adventures.
