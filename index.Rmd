Congrats you got an treasure map in a box! Woohoo!


We've hidden clues and activities throughout downtown Greensboro for you to find (and refreshments to consume along the way, because hydration is key!)


We've provided a #GnomeOnLoan from the heralded Lauren collection because we all know that gnomes love adventures.


## What you will need:

* Wear something warm enough to fit light to moderate movement outside (aka check the weather outside my friends)  
* At least 1 functioning smart phone, that can also take and send pictures  
* The black bag of goodies!  
* Wallets (id are important for adult oriented activities)   
* water bottles suggested for hydration  


## Recommended Time of Day: 

Depending on your wits, this will likely take you 2-4 hours. So it's best performed starting at 2pm on a Saturday. It is recommended that you park at the Green street parking garage (or somewhere close to that). 

## Instructions:  
* Open your black envelop (you should have already opened it to get to this site).  
* Ensure NFC is enabled and tap your phone to the card.  
* Use the clues provide to determine the locations for each step.   
* At the location open the indicated section of the bag and consume the following items. Note that the numbered section aligns with the number of the clue. Consume the item and proceed to completing the activity.   
* The password for the next clue is the location that you are currently at (always in lowercase). 


There are 6 locations and activities in total, you must take picture at each location with our #gnomeOnLoad, Glenn. This will serve a proof that you and your adventure companions had the smarts to make it through. But please return Glenn back to Phil and Lauren. He likes adventures, but gets cranky when he's away from his gnome pack for too long.


## Go to clue 1!
